Inspiration
We know that today every other person is addicted to either smoking, drinking , porn, video games. We wanted to do something for the social good which was when we came up with the idea of creating this website "DETOX" which would guide a person through their addiction recovery.

What it does
A person is required to create a profile on DETOX. Then a person is given two tasks per day which he must complete. He/she can track their progress as well. Also, we have a forum page wherein a person can seek support from similar people on the same journey.

How we built it
The front-end is built using CSS and HTML while the back-end uses python, flask and SQLite3.

Challenges we ran into
Firstly, the hackathon being online was in itself a challenge, we had quite a lot of trouble scheduling our meetings. Each one of us had assignments, exams scheduled within the same period. Also, one of our team members being in a different time zone was also a major challenge. Also, all of us had little to no experience participating in hackathons, so we could not build the website exactly the way we wanted.

Accomplishments that We are proud of
We are proud that we could overcome the afore mentioned challenges and successfully build a working website. We also feel proud that our website would help in the betterment of the society.

What we learned
We learnt how to make and handle databases. But most importantly, we learned team work.

What's next for Detox : De-addict at your own pace
We are planning to make an app for the same and provide recovery help with some more addictions. Also, we will add a feature for online help from advisors.
